1.a:  Based on what you have learnt in the class, do the following steps:
                 a. Create a new folder
                 b. Put the following files in the folder

                       Code.txt
                       Log.txt
                       Output.txt

                 c. Stage the Code.txt and Output.txt files                 
                 d. Commit them
                 e. And finally push them to GitHub

1.b: Please share the commands for the above points

A:  a. Creating a new folder

    bash: mkdir MyProject

    b. Putting the following files in the folder

    bash: touch Code.txt Log.txt Output.txt

    c. Staging the Code.txt and Output.txt files
    
    First, initialize the Git repository:

    bash: git init

    Then, stage the specific files:

    bash: git add Code.txt Output.txt

    d: Commit them

    bash: git commit -m "Added Code.txt and Output.txt files"

     e. Pushing them to GitHub

     Going to https://github.com and creating a new repository "MyProject".

     Copy the remote URL of the repo. 

     bash: git remote add origin https://github.com/AAKASHDEEP786/MyProject.git

         : git branch -M main
         : git push -u origin main


2: Tasks to Be Performed: 


1. Create a Git working directory with feature1.txt and feature2.txt in the master branch 

2. Create 3 branches develop, feature1 and feature2 

3. In develop branch create develop.txt, do not stage or commit it 

4. Stash this file and check out to feature1 branch 

5. Create new.txt file in feature1 branch, stage and commit this file 

6. Checkout to develop, unstash this file and commit 

7. Please submit all the Git commands used to do the above step

A: Step 1: Create Git working directory with feature1.txt and feature2.txt in master branch

   bash:mkdir Git-Project
        cd Git-Project
        git init

        touch feature1.txt feature2.txt
        echo "This is feature 1" > feature1.txt
        echo "This is feature 2" > feature2.txt

        git add feature1.txt feature2.txt
        git commit -m "Add feature1.txt and feature2.txt to master"

Step 2: Create 3 branches: develop, feature1, and feature2

    bash:git branch develop
         git branch feature1
         git branch feature2

Step 3: In develop branch create develop.txt, do not stage or commit

    bash:git checkout develop
         touch develop.txt
         echo "Development in progress" > develop.txt
    
        
Step 4: Stash this file and check out to feature1 branch

    bash:git stash
         git checkout feature1

Step 5: Create new.txt in feature1 branch, stage and commit
    
    bash:touch new.txt
         echo "This is new feature work" > new.txt

         git add new.txt
         git commit -m "Add new.txt to feature1 branch"

Step 6: Checkout to develop, unstash the file, and commit
    
    bash:git checkout develop
         git stash pop  # brings back develop.txt

         git add develop.txt
         git commit -m "Add develop.txt after unstashing"


3. Tasks to Be Performed: 


   1. Create a Git working directory, with the following branches: 


            Develop 

            F1 

            f2 


2. In the master branch, commit main.txt file 

3. Put develop.txt in develop branch, f1.txt and f2.txt in f1 and f2 respectively 

4. Push all these branches to GitHub

5. On local delete f2 branch 

6. Delete the same branch on GitHub as well


A: 1. Create a Git working directory with branches: develop, f1, f2

      bash:mkdir Git-MultiBranch-Task
           cd Git-MultiBranch-Task
           git init

   2. In the master branch, commit main.txt

      bash:touch main.txt
           echo "This is the main file" > main.txt

           git add main.txt
           git commit -m "Add main.txt to master"
    
   3. Create branches develop, f1, f2 and commit respective files

      bash:# Create and switch to develop
             git checkout -b develop
             touch develop.txt
             echo "This is the develop branch file" > develop.txt
             git add develop.txt
             git commit -m "Add develop.txt to develop branch"
             
             # Create and switch to f1
             git checkout -b f1
             touch f1.txt
             echo "This is F1 branch file" > f1.txt
             git add f1.txt
             git commit -m "Add f1.txt to f1 branch"
             
             # Create and switch to f2
             git checkout -b f2
             touch f2.txt
             echo "This is F2 branch file" > f2.txt
             git add f2.txt
             git commit -m "Add f2.txt to f2 branch"
  
  4:git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
            
        Then push all branches:
                 
            bash:git push -u origin master
                 git push -u origin develop
                 git push -u origin f1
                 git push -u origin f2
                 
  5: Delete f2 branch locally               
       
            bash:git branch -d f2
     
            git push origin --delete f2
